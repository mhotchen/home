## Manifesto

I fucking hate Atlassian. I can't even login to Bitbucket. I have an account, I'm logged in on one computer, but I can't login on another device. Every time I try to login I have to reset my password. And my recent attempts don't even allow me to do that.

Jira is the ultimate example of what not to do with UX: bloated, slow, mystery meat navigation, unpredictable actions, regressive updates. Every product team I've worked on has complained loudly about how shit this software is and somehow it continues to devolve.

Atlassian is taking its final breaths and at this point a stone and chisel would be more productive.

So the market is ripe for disruption. I'm here to disrupt.

The plan is to build a product for product teams that do it right. Instead of accomodating the companies that don't know how to be agile, I'm instead building a product for the teams who are agile, the ones that Atlassian are ignoring.

Let's reflect on the agile manfesto in the context of Atlassian:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Straight away Atlassian are in deep shit. Their entire product line is focused on the latter instead of the former. They create busywork within teams, and focus on justifying the jobs of those who pay them through complex tooling and processes.

Let's put the individuals and their interactions front and center. The tools should be hidden, and the processes informal.

Working software over comprehensive documentation

Given I can't even log in to Bitbucket I would posit that Atlassian are unable to produce working software. How can agile teams rely on nonfunctional software to manage their own products? At one company I worked for that adopted Atlassian it was a full-time job to manage their products. Their documentation is extensive and useless.

So let's build something obvious. Something that does its job and gets out of the way. Something that doesn't have 3 burger icons that you have to search through to perform a basic task.

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Atlassian certainly let their customers dictate the direction of their software (or at least I hope, why else would it be a bloated mess?), but are they collaborating? Their software appears to be the result of saying "yes" to any old idea in the hopes of making a buck. If they collaborated with their customers instead of worrying about their bottom line they might actually have a useful bit of software.

First I will build a product for the product team I work on. I collaborate with these people daily and see the pain points that Atlassian introduces. If all goes well I will extend this out to other mature product teams who know what they're doing.

Responding to change over following a plan

The only change I've seen to Atlassian's products is them strictly following a poorly laid out plan with no deviation when things have clearly gone awry. I've seen snails with more agility.

Let's welcome the unknown. The efficiency in the SDLC has improved considerably in recent years, and iteration is easier than ever. There is no need to still be using this bloated ancient piece of shit that was clearly built for yesteryear's development world.

This is not the company that should be in charge of your agile product team's roadmap. They are the antithesis of agile. Their products are the result of the mindset that their products accomodate. Do you also want your products to be a burning pile of dog shit?

What does an agile product team need from their product management software?

- A loose and flexible roadmap centered around epics
- Tasks
- A backlog of tasks that can be organised, discussed, and prioritized
- Optional sprints with a measurement for work to ensure that the team sets realistic expectations
- Retrospectives/continuous improvement
- A consistent flow from work definition to definition of done
- A place to document, collaborate, and share ideas, before they make it to the backlog
