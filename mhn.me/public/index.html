<h1>Who the hell is Matthew Hotchen?</h1>

<p>I build software and talk to people. Sometimes I make money doing these things.

<p>I’m in charge of the backend, data, and infrastructure for <a href="https://quitgenius.com">Quit Genius</a>. We are
    an awesome team that provide innovative new techniques in addiction treatment. We have helped more than 60,000
    people quit smoking. We have achieved a 53% quit rate in a ramdomised controlled trial for smokers, far higher
    than any existing smoking cessation methods. We also recently completed an $11,000,000 Series A round. You can find
    all of this information on
    <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/quit-genius-raises-11m-series-a-to-expand-into-opioid-alcohol-addiction-treatment/">
        a TechCrunch article detailing our Series A</a>.

<p>Previously I was a developer, team lead, and contractor at <a href="https://www.worldfirst.com">World First</a>, a
    foreign exchange brokerage with over $10,000,000,000 per year in transaction volume. Revenue and team growth were
    both explosive, and two years after my departure the company sold for $700,000,000. You can find this information on
    <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/alibabas-ant-financial-buys-worldfirst/">
        a TechCrunch article detailing their sale</a> (I promise I’m not associated with TechCrunch).

<p>I’ve also been a contractor for several years, tried and failed to build a startup helping tailors manage their
    businesses, worked at a tailoring company attempting (with little success) to bring the industry in to the 21st
    century, and my first job was as the sole employee at a digital agency working on high profile projects for clients
    such as News International and Universal Records.
