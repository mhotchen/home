<h1>Who is Matthew Hotchen?</h1>
<p>I build software and talk to people. Sometimes I make money doing these things.
<p>I’m the backend dev at DigiThera. DigiThera produces an app called Quit Genius that helps people quit smoking through
  cognitive behavioural therapy. I use the app and it works so I’m passionate about this role.
<p>In my spare time I’m also (slowly) building a platform to improve the lives of bespoke tailors.
<p>Previously I’ve worked at an FX brokerage, a made-to-measure tailoring company, a massive mattress producing company
  and much more. I’ve been building software for a decade. I mostly build APIs that communicate using JSON over HTTP but
  I’ve dabbled in building other types of software as well.
