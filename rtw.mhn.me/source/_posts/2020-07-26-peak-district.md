title: Peak District (2020-07-17)
---

I guess this is my blog.

It was my sister's birthday this week. She lives in Manchester. I took my motorcycle from London and took the scenic
route. The Peak District was the first place I ever went wild camping, so it felt apt to use it as a test bed for my
first motorcycle trip as well. One night in the Peak District, two with my sister.

Everything went smoothly. It was far easier than I expected. I got up to the Peak District simply through memorising
the necessary motorways/junctions then strapped my phone to my bike for the final stretch.

On my full day in the Peak District I mostly kept my phone in my bag, referencing it from time to time to work out
the next stretch. I zig-zagged from south to north. The remote northern part/dark peaks are genuinely amazing.

Getting over in to Manchester was easy as well. Clear signs everywhere.

Going home again I never bothered to check the route, and I made some scenic diversions through the Peak District again.

I didn't expect to enjoy the roads in the Peak District as much as I did. Breathtaking scenery, lovely hilly twisty
roads and very few users of the roads. The few road users I did encounter were always respectful.

I miss the north's friendliness. I was raised there. The random remote pub I went to had the local drunk sat outside
simply waiting to provide some local lore without hesitation and I couldn't walk past someone inside without a quick
chat. Amazing.

The trip has reaffirmed my belief that this is how I want to see the world.

## Things I learned

- A 20l bag is plenty, my 70l beast bag continues to sit unused on my shelf for now
- The roads in the UK are very clearly signed
- I'm a terrible rider (though I'm reminded of this nearly daily); I especially need to improve my gear shifts
- I love my bike
- This is fucking awesome
